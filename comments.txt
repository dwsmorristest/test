EVENTS

Not being able to touch the markup reduces the options, e.g. we have to reference the images by index instead of by class/id.

There is duplicated information due to the way the images are formatted. They should be cropped and positioned by CSS. 
Then we can use jQuery handlers for mouseover/mouseout, or hover, directly on structural elements of the page rather than needing complicated manual bound calculations. 
The current setup is also brittle to resource modification. 

I don't like css poluting markup, or styles being directly modified by JavaScript as is being done here :). I'd like to separate out the HTML, CSS and JS in a clearer way, 
e.g. I like the web components standard/polymer.js that lets you separate concerns within a single reusable component file.


TRANSPORT

Browsers implement the same-origin policy to prevent access to content served by third-party domains. 
CORS is a W3C recommended standard for allowing such cross-origin requests.

To make an ajax call to speechmatics.com, I have directed the request via the CORS Anywhere proxy server. 
This initiates the request on behalf of our application, and adds CORS headers to the response so that it may be processed by our page.

The response header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" has been added by CORS Anywhere and is visible in the output on our page. 
The header permits scripts hosted on any site from accessing the resource.
